NLP-TAB Corpus
=======================
The NLP-TAB corpus is a collection of 120 UTF-8 plain text synthetic clinical notes. These
notes are sourced from the MTSamples corpus, available in its entirety from 
[www.mtsamples.com](http://www.mtsamples.com/). These 120 documents are located in the 
Documents folder.

It is important to not do any preprocessing or manipulation of the text in your processing
pipeline. NLP-TAB matches documents between systems using checksums, so any modification, 
however small, will prevent comparisons between systems.

[University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics NLP/IE Group](http://www.bmhi.umn.edu/ihi/research/nlpie/) and
